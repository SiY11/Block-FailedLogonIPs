# Block-FailedLogonIPs

PowerShell script to monitor Event ID 4625 (failed logon attempts) on a Windows server or client, auto-blocking non-US IPs on the first attempt and US IPs with more than a configurable number of attempts (default: 5) in a configurable time window (default: 10 minutes). Uses ip-api.com for geolocation with batch queries for efficiency.

## Features
- Auto-blocks non-US IPs on first attempt, US IPs with >5 attempts in 10 minutes.
- Checks existing firewall rules before API calls to minimize requests.
- Uses ip-api.com (45 req/min for single queries, 15 req/min for batch queries).
- Logs new rules, existing rules, and errors to `C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\BlockIP.log`.
- Configurable thresholds for attempts and time window, with dynamic parameters for manual runs.
- Log rotation (10 MB max) with unlimited retention (enabled).
- Rate limit tracking in `C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\IPAPILimits.json` with daily backups.

## Prerequisites
- Windows 10 Pro or Server with PowerShell 5.1.
- Administrative privileges for creating Windows Firewall rules.
- Write access to `C:\BlockIPScript\Logs` for logs and rate limit tracking.
- Internet access for ip-api.com API calls.
- Git for version control (optional for local use).

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Block-FailedLogonIPs.git
    cd Block-FailedLogonIPs
    ```
- Copy Block-FailedLogonIPs.ps1 to C:\BlockIPScript\script.

## Usage
### Manual Run
- Run the script with optional threshold parameters:
    ```powershell
    .\Block-FailedLogonIPs.ps1 -AttemptThreshold 3 -TimeWindowMinutes 5
    ```

### Task Scheduler
- Create a task triggered by Event ID 4625 (Security log) with a 10-second delay.
- Use a local service account with admin rights (e.g., IPBlockService).
- Set the action to: 
    ```powershell 
    powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "C:\BlockIPScript\script\Block-FailedLogonIPs.ps1" 
    ```
- See script header for setup details.

## Configuration
##### Edit the scriptâ€™s configuration section to adjust:
- ``$AttemptThreshold``: Default 5 attempts for US IPs.
- ``$TimeWindowMinutes``: Default 10-minute window.
- ``$LogRetentionUnlimited``: Set to true for unlimited log retention (currently enabled).
- ``$LogRetentionDays``: Days to keep archived logs if not unlimited (default: 365).
- ``$MaxLogSizeMB``: Max log size before rotation (default: 10 MB).
- ``$LimitsBackupRetentionDays``: Days to keep limits file backups (default: 7).

## Logs
- **Event Logs**: ``C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\BlockIP.log`` (new rules, existing rules, errors).
- **Rate Limits**: ``C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\IPAPILimits.json`` (API call limits).
- **Archives**: ``C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\BlockIP_YYYYMMDD.log.zip`` (rotated logs, unlimited retention).
- **Backups**: ``C:\BlockIPScript\Logs\IPAPILimits_YYYYMMDD.json`` (7-day retention).
